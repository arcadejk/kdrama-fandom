# 7. Technologies Used

Our fandom website leverages a variety of technologies to create a seamless and engaging user experience. Here are the key technologies we used and the reasons for their selection:

## 7.1 HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

- **Reason for Use:** HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and is essential for structuring the content of our website. We use HTML to define the layout, headings, paragraphs, images, and other elements of each webpage, ensuring a clear and organized presentation of information for our users.

## 7.2 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- **Reason for Use:** CSS is used to style the visual presentation of our website, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. We use CSS to customize the appearance of HTML elements and create a visually appealing and cohesive design that aligns with our branding and enhances the user experience.

## 7.3 Gitpod

- **Reason for Use:** Gitpod is an online integrated development environment (IDE) that allows us to code, collaborate, and deploy our website from any device with an internet connection. We use Gitpod to streamline our development workflow, collaborate with team members in real-time, and access our codebase securely from anywhere, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in our development process.

## 7.4 Balsamiq

- **Reason for Use:** Balsamiq is a lightweight and modular CSS framework based on Balsamiq Design System that provides pre-designed components and styles for building responsive and accessible user interfaces. We use Balsamiq to speed up the development process, ensure consistency in design across different components and pages, and optimize our website for various screen sizes and devices.

## 7.5 GitHub

- **Reason for Use:** GitHub is a popular platform for hosting and managing software development projects using the Git version control system. We use GitHub to store our codebase, track changes, collaborate with team members, and deploy our website. GitHub provides features such as pull requests, issues tracking, and project management tools that help streamline our development workflow and ensure transparency and accountability in our project management process.

By leveraging these technologies, we are able to create a robust and user-friendly fandom website that delivers a seamless and engaging experience for our audience while maximizing efficiency and collaboration in our development process.

### 8. Testing

#### 8.1 Code Validation

During the testing phase, I ensured the codebase adhered to best practices and standards by subjecting it to three validation processes.

- **HTML Validation:** Utilizing the official W3C validator, I confirmed that no errors were returned, ensuring the HTML markup is compliant with industry standards.

  https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea
  
- **CSS Validation:** The CSS code underwent validation through the official Jigsaw validator, where it was verified to be error-free, maintaining consistency and integrity in styling.

  https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator

- **Accessibility:** Accessibility is a crucial aspect of web development. To ensure inclusivity, I verified that the chosen colors and fonts are easy to read and accessible. This was accomplished by running the website through Lighthouse in the browser's developer tools.

 **9.1.1 Development:** We develop and test our website locally in Gitpod's online integrated development environment (IDE), ensuring that it functions correctly and meets our design and functionality requirements.

 **9.1.2 Commit Changes:** Once we are satisfied with the changes, we commit them to our Git repository using Gitpod's version control system. We include descriptive commit messages to track the changes and updates made to the codebase.

 **9.1.3 Push to GitHub:** After committing the changes, we push the code to our GitHub repository, making it accessible to other team members and ensuring that all changes are synchronized across the development environment.

 **9.1.4 Continuous Integration:** We utilize continuous integration tools and services integrated with Gitpod, such as GitHub Actions or Gitpod's native CI/CD capabilities, to automatically build and deploy our website whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.

 **9.1.5 Review and Testing:** Before deploying the changes to production, we review and test the website to ensure that it functions correctly and meets our quality standards. We perform thorough testing on different devices and browsers to identify and address any compatibility issues.

 **9.1.6 Deployment:** Once the changes have been reviewed and tested successfully, we deploy the website using Gitpod's deployment capabilities or other deployment tools integrated with our development environment. This process ensures that the latest version of the website is deployed to our hosting environment for public access.

## 9.2 Deployment via GitHub Pages

To deploy our website using GitHub Pages, we follow these steps:

 **9.1 Configuration:** We configure our GitHub repository to enable GitHub Pages hosting for our project. This involves specifying the source branch and the directory containing the website files to be published.
